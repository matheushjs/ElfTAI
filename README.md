# Elf TAS (Title - Alias - Strings)

# Motivation
<p>Consider the following situation: you have a big set of documents to read, each of which are labeled with the area of knowledge they cover (psychology, mathematics etc). Also, each document has it's ID number.</p>
<p>The Elf TAS program will try to build a generic command-line manager for such situations, where the following are TRUE:</p>
<ul>
<li>There exists a big set of objects (documents in this case), and we want to record which of these objects have been processed (in this case, read).</li>
<li>There exists a reduced number of titles (labels, in this case), where each title characterizes a set of objects.</li>
<li>Each object is characterized by only 1 Title.</li>
</ul>
